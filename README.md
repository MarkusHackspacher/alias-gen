# ALIAS-GEN

This script will create bash/zsh/fish shell aliases automatically. You can generate a new alias file by following the prompts, or use --stdout to print results directly in your terminal.

Two types of aliases are suggested, the default alias matches all characters in the command while min_alias aims to minimize the length of characters. Additionally, min_alias does not necessarily match all characters in the command. The freq (frequency) column shows how often this command was used. For now, this script only generates aliases for the first word in a command. NOTE: Two character commands or less are not processed.

By default, fish shell generates abbr (abbreviations) rather than aliases.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo:

```
git clone <https://this-repo-url>
```

CD into the repo directory:

```
cd alias-gen
```

## Running the script

Full Help Menu:

```
python aliaser.py -h
```

Example usage with top 40 aliases:

```
python aliaser.py -n 40
```

With stdout and min_alias:

```
python aliaser.py --stdout --use_min_alias
```

Generate for fish shell:

```
python aliaser.py -s fish
```

Generate for zsh with custom history file path:

```
python aliaser.py -s zsh -f ./.custom_zsh_history
```

## How does it work?

The `alias` column is generated by first sorting the most common commands found
in the history file, then aliases are generated for commands more than two
characters. These aliases just try to match character per character the given
command and will continue with more characters if there is a previous common
alias.

The `min_alias` column tries to minimize the total length of chars disregarding
the rule of matching the command character per character. It is generated using
the first char of the command always, followed by easy to reach keyboard characters
defined as QUERTY layout middle row, top row, then bottom row.

## Misc

I recommend using this script along with other shell plugins that help you remember
your alias or abbreviation. One example for fish shell is [fish-abbreviation-tips](https://github.com/gazorby/fish-abbreviation-tips)

## TODO

- [ ] Have python alias-gen module run cli commands easier, rather then having
      to run the .py script from ./src/alias_gen/aliaser.py. It should be
      simpler, something like: `python -m alias-gen mycommand`
- [ ] Fix comands that start with ./script.sh cannot have alias of . or / or
      ~ or \_.
- [ ] Put more debug statements in stategic places
- [ ] Add arg to allow alias for fish over abbr.

- [ ] Add gitlab pipelines for quality of code / linting.
- [ ] Add pipeline for vulnerabilities/secrets.
- [ ] Package everything with poetry.
- [ ] Publish to public gitlab
- [ ] Publish to public github
- [ ] Write an article about this and how ChatGPT helped write boilerplate.
- [ ] Publish my own website with that article.
- [x] Test out publish + version bumping using twine + setuptools
- [x] Move this script into its own repo
- [x] Add an MIT license
